# NginxCLI

ðŸŒ´ Create and manage your **Nginx** configs from the command line.

## Installing the NginxCLI

```bash
composer global require la-moore/nginx-cli
```

Make sure to place Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory in your `$PATH` so the `nginx-cli` executable can be located by your system.
If you don't know where your `$PATH` is, run this command to find out:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
```

Once installed, you should be able to run `nginx-cli {command}` from within any directory.

## Updating the NginxCLI

```bash
composer global update la-moore/nginx-cli
```

Run this command to update the CLI tool to the most recent published version. If there's been a major version release, you may need to run `require` instead of update.
